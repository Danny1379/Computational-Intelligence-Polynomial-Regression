# Computational-Intelligence-Course_Polynomial-Regression_HomeWork1
An implementation of polynomial Regression using python numpy on the daily cases of Corona in the first 277 days in Iran.
this code was intended to be an implementation for learning purpose and it personally helped me understand a lot about regression i hope it will be useful to others as well.
there is still a need for some work on it and a clean up to make it more readable and work better.
this code was origionaly written in google colabratory and has been re written.
the data has also been included , this data was taken from wikipedia and most certainly been updated so i would recommend gathering your own data but this should give you a good understanding of the form of the data.
any feedback will be appreciated thank you.
